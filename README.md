# PROJECT TITLE: INTO THE CRYPTOVERSE

# DESCRIPTION:

### PROJECT OVERVIEW:
"Into the Cryptoverse" is an educational web-based game that aims to teach players about blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in an engaging and interactive manner. Players choose from 5 unique characters, each with individual strengths and weaknesses, and navigate a game board with 100 blocks. These blocks include standard blocks, flash blocks with question cards, action blocks with special character-based actions, and trap blocks with unique consequences. Dice rolls determine movement, and players answer questions correctly to earn tokens while losing tokens for incorrect answers. Lifelines can be used to escape action or trap blocks. The game is designed to be easy to understand for those new to cryptocurrency and enjoyable for all players, with interactive gameplay mechanics, diverse characters, and a leaderboard feature to track progress and achievements.
